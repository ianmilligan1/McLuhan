## Working Locally

If you are working locally with this repo, you can prototype it yourself. To view the visualization, if you are using Python 2.7 please type:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1234
```

Then go into a web browser and type `http://localhost:1234/` into the URL bar.

If you're using Python 3, you can use 

```
python3 -m http.server 1234
```

Then go into a browser and visit `http://localhost:1234`.
