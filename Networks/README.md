Here are the results from link extraction scripts. For each collection, there are three files:

- one **GDF** file: This is the raw output of the Spark script, and can be loaded directly into Gephi;
- one **Gephi** file: This is the previous file with some network analysis run, more usable for subsequent analysis;
- one **PDF** file: This is a 'preview' of each network diagram.
