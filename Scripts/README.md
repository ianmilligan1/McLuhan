This directory holds scripts that are extracting data from two collections:
- the [Canadian Political Parties and Political Interest Groups collection](https://archive-it.org/collections/227), an Archive-It collection gathered by the University of Toronto;
- the [crawl of sites tweeted on the #elxn42 hashtag](http://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dvn/dv/wahr/faces/study/StudyPage.xhtml?globalId=hdl:10864/11311), collected by Nick Ruest and myself at York University/Waterloo;

This is to get data into a format for analysis, including:
- URL and Domain counts for dynamic visualizations ([a la this](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase/vis/crawl-sites/));
- Network diagrams so we can begin to look at link structures, [available in this part of the repo](https://github.com/ianmilligan1/McLuhan/tree/master/Networks);
- Full text so we can begin to extract topics, compare textual content, etc.

Mostly, it's to keep everything in one place.
