These were NER frequency outputs cleaned up using OpenRefine. Work done by Patrick O'Leary and Katie Mackinnon, MA students in the Department of History @ UWaterlo.

## Workflow

- Take the OpenRefine from Patrick/Katie, who go through and 'edit and cluster' using different distant measures;
- Review decisions;
- Open in Excel to generate Pivot table (stored on second sheet); 
- Pivot Table removes duplicates.

Files are stored in categories, `loc`, `org`, and `pers`.
